# cloud-lifecycle-controller

`cloud-controller-manager` too heavy for your cluster?  
Need a simple way to remove nodes from your cluster once they're shut down / removed in the cloud provider?

Look no further!

**This project is completely alpha, don't use it on your production cluster.** I won't take responsibility if it eats your cluster, your lunch, or both.
